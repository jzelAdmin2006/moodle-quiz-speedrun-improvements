# Moodle Quiz Shortcuts for Speedrunning

I hacked together this [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) user script in order to be faster at solving Moodle quizzes.
Make sure to enable developer mode in your browser to allow user script injection.

Currently, you can jump to the next question and submit finished quizzes by simply pressing [Enter], which is already quite a lot faster than clicking. Additionally, the script will detect when a question hasn't been answered completely and won't jump to the next question in that case if [Enter] has been pressed. More shortcuts and/or features may follow in the future.
